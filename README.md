## Security Measures

- **Data Encryption:** Currently, files and messages are not encrypted on the server. However, no one can access them. As a free service, I cannot afford intensive server-side encryption. As the project evolves, encryption will be added in the future. Additionally, if you are concerned, the transmission between the server and the client is fully encrypted.
- **Session Management:** Secure session handling to protect user data.
- **Environment Configuration:** Different settings for development and production to ensure security and performance.
